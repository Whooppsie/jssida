            I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
            Ain't it sad?
            And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
            That's too bad
            In my dreams I have a plan
            If I got me a wealthy man
            I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball
            Money, money, money
            Must be funny
            In the rich man's world
            Money, money, money
            Always sunny
            In the rich man's world
            Aha
            All the things I could do
            If I had a little money
            It's a rich man's world
            It's a rich man's world
            A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
            Ain't it sad?
            And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
            That's too bad
            So I must leave, I'll have to go
            To Las Vegas or Monaco
            And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same
            Money, money, money
            Must be funny
            In the rich man's world
            Money, money, money
            Always sunny
            In the rich man's world
            Aha

            Money, get away
            You get a good job with good pay and you're okay
            Money, it's a gas
            Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
            A new car, caviar, four star daydream
            Think I'll buy me a football team
            Money, well, get back
            I'm all right Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
            Money, it's a hit
            Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
            I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
            You know, I think I need a Lear jet
            Money, it's a crime
            Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
            Money, so they say
            Is the root of all evil today
            But if you ask for a raise
            It's no surprise that they're giving none away
            Away, away
            Away, away
            Away, away
            I was in the right
            Yes, absolutely in the righ
            I certainly was in the right
            You was definitely in the right, that geezer was cruising for a bruising
            Why does anyone do anything?
            I don't know, I was really drunk at the time
            I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number two
            He was asking why he wasn't coming up on freely
            After I yelling and screaming and telling him why
